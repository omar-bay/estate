to make it appear in apps, we appended to __manifest__.py
    'application': True

creating table estate_property

ORM layer makes us avoid writing SQL

we create python object, and ORM will translate them to tables

```
from odoo import models

class TestModel(models.Model):
    _name = "test.model"
```
ORM will generate database table names test_model
it reads the '.' as '_'

this is going in the module_name/models/crm_recurring_plan.py file
then it's imported in the module_name/models/__init__.py file
and the folder models is imported in module_name/__init__.py

don't forget to upgrade your module when editing in the table.

test table:
    psql -d demo15
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM estate_property;

a file importing data is located in the module_name/data folder
when the data is related to security, it's located in the module_name/security folder
when data is related to view and actions, it's located in the module_name/views folder

all of these files should be declared in 'data' list in __manifest__.py file

now we do some UI
link a menu to estate.property table so we can create new records.

when you do a view, add it to __manifest__.py

the menus inside the module are called action menus

the selling price should be read-only and the number of bedrooms and the availability date should have default values.

the selection values are in small case

next step is to define our own views

make the tree in the main views. the estate_property_views.xml

the <group/> seems to put wrap data with value
the <field name="attribute"/> gets the data value

define a link to res.partner
partner_id = fields.Many2one("res.partner", string="Partner")
then we can
print(my_test_object.partner_id.name)

add security to each model

the action attribute in menuitem looks like model name but with _action

the salesperson must be an employee (odoo user)
res.partner: a partner is a physical or legal entity. It can be a company, an individual or even a contact address.
res.users: the users of the system. Users can be ‘internal’, i.e. they have access to the Odoo backend. Or they can be ‘portal’, i.e. they cannot access the backend, only the frontend

user_id = fields.Many2one('res.users', string='Salesperson', index=True, tracking=True, default=lambda self: self.env.user)
user_email = fields.Char('User Email', related='user_id.email', readonly=True)

~~self.env~~
self.env.cr or self._cr is the database cursor object; it is used for querying the database
self.env.uid or self._uid is the current user’s database id
self.env.user is the current user’s record
self.env.context or self._context is the context dictionary
self.env.ref(xml_id) returns the record corresponding to an XML id
self.env[model_name] returns an instance of the given model

tags are Many2many relation

example
tax_ids = fields.Many2many("account.tax", string="Taxes")
for tax in my_test_object.tax_ids:
    print(tax.name)

to make a One2many, you need to have a Many2one there

the object self is a recordset

computed fields are not in the database
there's a store=True param

when something is triggred in the form view, self will be a single record

By assigning type="object" to our button, the Odoo framework will execute a Python method with name="action_do_something" on the given model.
action method should always return something

buttons can be linked to actions
<button type="action" name="%(test.test_model_action)d" string="My Action"/>

about the python constraints for the selling price not to be lower than 90% of expected price,
i'll use it in offer

SQL constraints are more efficient than python constraints

in the form header, we want the state or status or stage bar
we do this for a fields.Selection type
<field name="state" widget="statusbar" statusbar_visible="new,offer recieved,offer accepted,sold"/>

same fields multiple times are not supported

default list order can be defined directly in the model as
_order = "id desc"
descending id

ordering can also be on the view level:
<tree default_order="date desc">
    <field name="date"/>
    ...

in estate.property.type we have a field sequence to allow manual sort

in the widget fields we can all the options attribute to make some customizations

a color picker widget
<field name="color" widget="color_picker"/>

state selection is a preserved field in odoo just like active. 
we use its functionality in states= in view

other way to alter visibility
<form>
    <field name="description" attrs="{'invisible': [('is_partner', '=', False)]}"/>
    <field name="is_partner" invisible="1"/>
</form>

to prevent adding new offer, we did readonly under condition

to make list/tree edit without opening form:
editable='top' or editable='bottom'
